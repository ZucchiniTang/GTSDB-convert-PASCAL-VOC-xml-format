# Converting GTSDB 'gt.txt' into '*.xml' PASCAL VOC format

## Use Directly 
If you don't want to create folder by yourself, you can use two folders **'test_anno_xml'** and **'train_anno_xml'** as groundtruth directly

## Create by yourself steps:
1. Download GTSDB dataset
2. Change *'gt.txt'* to (*'gt_test.txt'* and *'gt_train.txt'*).
3. Run code *'gtsdb_convert_xml.py'*, this step will create two folders **'test_anno_xml'** and **'train_anno_xml'**, which include created *'\*.xml'* inside.
